common
======

This project contains files including 3rd party projects that are used by other projects. This project may not have any value if used alone.

## Why this project?
Because there is no good solution to manage multiple projects that share some common code. So, I am using this workaround.  
[Git-submodule](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule) sucks and is not what I want.
